mÃ¥ bruke nvidia CDI (Container Device Interface).

> CDI is an open specification for container runtimes that abstracts what access to a device, such as an NVIDIA GPU, means, and standardizes access across container runtimes. Popular container runtimes can read and process the specification to ensure that a device is available in a container. CDI simplifies adding support for devices such as NVIDIA GPUs because the specification is applicable to all container runtimes that support CDI.
